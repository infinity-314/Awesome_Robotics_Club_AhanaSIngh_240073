I’ve always been genuinely excited by robots — their functioning, their construction, and how they bring together mechanics, electronics, and intelligence. What fascinates me most is not just that a robot can move or follow instructions, but that it can actually think and make decisions on its own.
That’s exactly why I chose the project Autonomous Navigation. The idea that a robot can assess its environment, calculate the least expensive path, and independently find its way to a destination — just like a human would — really captivated me. It’s more than just motion; it’s about intelligent movement.
We use pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra, which allow the robot to plan routes based on terrain cost, not just distance. It’s like giving the robot a GPS that understands the effort behind every step — whether it’s a smooth tile or a muddy patch.
Another reason this project appealed to me is the programming side — especially since the prerequisite was C++, a language I’ve been learning and enjoying since January. This project is the perfect opportunity to build on that foundation, applying what I’ve learned in a real, hands-on robotics system.
